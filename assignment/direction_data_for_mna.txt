IMPORTANT: COMPONENT DIRECTIONS FOR MNA MATRIX
=============================================
The direction information in the detected components dictionary
MUST be used for determining current flow in MNA matrix formation.

For current sources: Current flows FROM 'start' TO 'end'
For voltage sources: Positive terminal at 'start', negative at 'end'
For diodes: Anode at 'start', cathode at 'end'

When building comp_connections or node assignments for the MNA matrix,
make sure you use this direction information rather than a different ordering.
